    "about": "Ever since I was about 14-15 years old, the world of bits,transistors & how they all come together to make things work has fascinated me. That curiosity brought my interest in computers and soon enough, I found myself diving into programming languages. I came across the term 'Artificial Intelligence' during my higher secondary education.\n During my bachelor's, I also discovered my passion for web dev, which opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for me. Now, I enjoy working with both AI and web technologies, constantly exploring how to create innovative solutions.",
