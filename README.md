# Project Title

Personal Portfolio Web Application

## Description

This is my personal portfolio website, built using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with animations powered by Framer Motion and smooth scrolling implemented via Locomotive Scroll. The site includes interactive features like "Cat Eye Tracking" and a "Riddle Generator" to enhance user engagement. Itâ€™s fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across all devices. I carefully selected a sophisticated color palette for a soothing visual experience, complemented by aesthetic fonts that align with the overall design. To further elevate the user experience, I've incorporated various icons, images, and Lottie animations.
